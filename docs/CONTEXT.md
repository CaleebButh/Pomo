# Pomo Desktop App Documentation

## Overview
Pomo is a productivity desktop application designed to help users focus on one task at a time. The app features a simple and intuitive interface centered around a customizable timer and rest period system. When opened, the app displays four UI elements: a logo, a radial adjustable clock/timer, a start button, and an end button.

## Key Features

### 1. Initial UI Elements
- **Logo**: A text-based logo ("POMO") centered at the top of the window.
- **Radial Adjustable Clock**:
  - A circular element with a radial overlay that allows users to adjust the timer duration by dragging the circumference.
  - Displays the number of minutes selected (e.g., "25 minutes").
  - Plays a tick sound for each second change in the timer value.

### 2. Timer Configuration
- **Adjusting Time**:
  - Users can drag the circumference of the radial clock to increase or decrease the timer duration.
  - The timer updates in real-time as the user drags and displays the new time (e.g., "30 minutes").
  - Each second change in the timer is accompanied by a single tick sound.

### 3. Session Flow
- **Begin Button**:
  - Located directly below the radial clock.
  - Starts the countdown timer based on the selected duration when clicked.
  - The timer decreases until it reaches zero, at which point a rest period begins.

- **Rest Period**:
  - After the timer completes, the app starts a 15-minute rest period.
  - During this time, the UI remains static, but the app plays a notification sound when the rest period is complete to signal that a new focus session can begin.

### 4. Session Summary
- **End Button**:
  - Located to the right of the Begin button.
  - Stops the current timer and displays a summary screen when clicked.
  - The summary includes:
    - Total time spent in focus mode (summarized by minutes).
    - Number of rest periods taken during the session.

## Implementation Notes

### UI/UX Design
- **Centered Layout**: All elements are centered on the screen for ease of use.
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - The radial clock should provide clear visual feedback when being dragged (e.g., color change or animation).
  - The Begin and End buttons should have hover effects and be disabled during certain states (e.g., Begin button is disabled while a timer is running).

### Sound Effects
- **Tick Sound**: A subtle, ticking sound plays each time the timer is adjusted for every one second adjusted.
- **Notification Sound**: A more prominent sound plays when a rest period ends or when a session is complete.

### State Management
- **Focus Session**:
  - The app tracks the start and end of focus sessions, updating the total focus time accordingly.
- **Rest Periods**:
  - Each completed focus session increments the rest period counter by one.
  - Rest periods are tracked but do not contribute to the total focus time.

### Summary Screen
- **Display**: The summary screen appears when the End button is clicked or when the app is closed (if a session was active).
- **Data**:
  - Total focus time: Calculated as the sum of all completed timer durations.
  - Number of rest periods: Counted each time a rest period concludes.

## Assumptions and Constraints
- **Platform**: The app will be developed for Windows, macOS, or Linux. (To be determined by the developer.)
- **Language**: Python with Tkinter or similar GUI framework is preferred.
- **Dependencies**: Any external libraries used must be compatible with the target platform(s).
- **Notifications**: The notification system should work across all platforms without requiring additional setup.

## Conclusion
Pomo is designed to be a simple yet effective productivity tool. By focusing on clear visual feedback, intuitive controls, and a streamlined workflow, users can easily manage their focus sessions and rest periods throughout the day. This documentation provides a detailed breakdown of the app's functionality, ensuring that developers have a clear understanding of how the app should behave and function.
